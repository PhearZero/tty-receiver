> JavaScript library for `tty-share`

This was directly copied from [tty-share](https://github.com/elisescu/tty-share) and full
credit goes to [@elisescu](https://github.com/elisescu). This library is just for use in 
custom frontends to make integrations easier.

## Building
The frontend uses webpack to build everything in a bundle file. Run:
```
npm install
tsc
```
